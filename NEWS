Changes in 1.4
*******************
NEW FEATURES
    o Function csSAMfit provides an enhanced and provides a formula interface.
    See ?csSAMfit for details.
     
*******************
Changes in 1.3
*******************

CHANGES
    o FDR-related intensive computations are now implemented in C++.
    This adds a dependency to Rcpp and require the package to be compiled.
    Dependency to the compiler package is dropped.
    o csSAM gains an argument stat.only which enables to choose between
    short/long return format.
    o csfit now also returns the number of samples used in the estimation 

BUG FIXES
    o runSAM was computing sample-wise instead of gene-wise statistics, 
    when argument stand.r=FALSE, which is not the default so this bug did 
    not affect any computation made via csSamWrapper.
    o findSigGene was assigning incorrect FDR thresholds for alternative 
    hypothesis 'less' and 'greater'. This would typically make a 
    difference for high FDR values or in data with effects biased towards 
    up or down regulation. See help page ?findSigGene.


*******************
Changes in 1.2.4:
*******************
CHANGES
    o Some speed-up have been obtained using byte-compiled 
    functions

BUG FIXES
    o Fixes bug in computation of the fdr for alternative "less",
    for which the fdr values were incorrect.
